            Weather Classification is an exciting project that aims to predict and classify weather conditions into four main categories: Rainy, Cloudy, Shine, and Sunrise. This project utilizes a powerful ensemble model combining state-of-the-art deep learning architectures such as CNN, VGG16, and DenseNet201. By leveraging the strengths of these models, we aim to provide accurate and reliable weather predictions, helping you plan your day more effectively.
